            <p>And now as I said concerning faith— faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</p>

            <h2>Alma 32:22</h2>
            <p>And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word. In our colloquial language, belief and faith are essentially equivalent.</p>
